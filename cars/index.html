            <h3>Why I Like Cars</h3>
            <p>Cars are some of my favorite things. Cars are usualy just a way to get around. But there are some cars out there that are more than that.</p>

               <p></p>They could be the machine that someone put there hearts and soul into. Knowing that somone desinged those special cars makes me think they are artists and that they have created art.
